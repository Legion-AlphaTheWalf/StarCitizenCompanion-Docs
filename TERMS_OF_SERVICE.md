2. Description of Service
The Bot provides real-time information, updates, and data related to Star Citizen. It aggregates content—including data from third-party services such as UEX’s APIs—for informational and entertainment purposes only. The Bot is not intended as a substitute for official or professional advice.

Note: The Bot owner reserves the right to update this list of prohibited behaviors as necessary.
4. Data and Third-Party Services
The Bot retrieves data from third-party sources (including UEX’s APIs). While every effort is made to ensure data accuracy, the Bot owner does not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of such data. You acknowledge that any reliance on third-party data is at your own risk, and the Bot owner is not liable for inaccuracies or interruptions resulting from those services.

No Warranties: The Bot is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without any warranties—express or implied—including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
Limitation of Liability: In no event shall the Bot owner be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with your use of the Bot.
Indemnification: You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Bot owner from any claims, damages, or losses resulting from your use of the Bot or violation of these Terms.
6. Termination
The Bot owner reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Bot, with or without notice, if you violate these Terms or if deemed necessary for operational or security reasons. Upon termination, any rights granted to you under these Terms will immediately cease.

7. Changes to the Terms
The Bot owner may update these Terms at any time. Notice of changes may be provided via the Bot or associated channels. Your continued use of the Bot following any modifications signifies your acceptance of the updated Terms. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.

8. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Bot owner operates, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes shall be resolved by binding arbitration or in the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction.
